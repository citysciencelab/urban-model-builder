# Sharing a Model

Work in real time and collaborate with other users on a model!  
By sharing your model, you invite others to help shape it and contribute their individual perspectives.

## Settings
In the **Version Settings** section of the sidebar, youâ€™ll find the **Share** function with the following options:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Email | Email address of the recipient |
| Role | Permission level granted to the recipient |
| No Permission | The recipient is not (yet) authorized, and the model will not be visible to them |
| View | The recipient can only view the model but cannot edit it |
| Contributor | The recipient can edit/clone the model and create a new draft |
| Co-Owner | In addition to the creator, the co-owner can also share and publish the model, as well as edit it |
