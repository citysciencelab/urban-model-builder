# Navigating Model Land

You find yourself in the middle of Model Land, standing before countless options: forks in the road, intersections, and perhaps even dead ends or construction sites.  You’ve coded a portion of the real world and built your model from it.  Now, within Model Land, a unique logic exists — one you have designed alone or with a team.  

Explore the possibilities: the paths, the activities, the surroundings.  This world is dynamic, and you can change, refine, and guide it during your journey.  You may often find yourself asking, *“What if…?”* — and here is the place to explore exactly those questions.

You look at the map you brought along.  Blank areas mark the unexplored parts of your model.  Some will be easy to reach, others less likely.  Certain paths are marked by deep uncertainties, making their destinations seem far from secure.

To form the most resilient and well-founded opinion possible, you’re convinced of this:  The more paths you travel, the more confidently you can say which is the most beautiful, the most comfortable, the longest but with the best view, the most exhausting but fastest, or the riskiest.  Test a wide range of scenarios!  
How?

You can configure the prevailing conditions, circumstances, and dependencies at both global and local levels — much like setting the climate for the model globally, and the weather locally.

- In the [Model Settings](../Einstellungen/Modell-%20Einstellungen) you set global parameters.
- The [Scenario Settings](../Einstellungen/Szenario-%20Einstellungen) let you try out different configurations.

You set off along a path you’ve chosen.  On the map, you watch as it gradually takes shape step by step.  The [simulation](../Simulation%20durchführen) runs and finally reveals your destination.

Whether it’s what you expected, where you wanted to go, whether it’s your final stop or just a waypoint — that’s for you to decide.  Of course, you can ask your fellow travelers for their perspective!
Make your results transparent: [publish the model](../Publizieren/Modell%20veröffentlichen) for the whole community or [share the model](../Publizieren/Modell%20teilen) with selected users.

Want to remember one path but try another?  Create different [model versions](../Einstellungen/Versions-Einstellungen) to document your journey.

The future is not about prediction — it’s about discovery.
