# The “Model Land”
## A place of abstraction and complexity
Models help us understand complex realities, test possible courses of action, and make informed decisions. Every model, however, involves simplification, interpretation, and responsibility.  The challenges this brings can be vividly illustrated through the metaphor of *Model Land*[^1] — an abstract country full of mathematical relationships and calculations waiting to be explored.

Based on this metaphor, we’ve prepared this short guide to help you navigate the world of modeling.  We aim to provide not only the basic technical and mathematical foundations but also a socio-cultural understanding of modeling. The Urban Model Builder is your tool for diving into and exploring Model Land together with others. With it, you can create models, run simulations, and analyze the results.

The metaphor of Model Land comes largely from the book *Escape from Model Land – How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It*[^1].  
This guide offers you a practical overview and thought-provoking ideas for building, simulating, and interpreting digital models.

The following three chapters:

1. [Entering Model Land](model-land-betreten.md) – Creating a model  
2. [Navigating Model Land](model-land-navigieren.md) – Simulating a model  
3. [Leaving Model Land](model-land-verlassen.md) – Using model results  

take you on a narrative journey through the Urban Model Builder’s application — and much more beyond that.
