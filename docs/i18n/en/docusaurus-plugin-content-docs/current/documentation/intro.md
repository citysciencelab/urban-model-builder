# Welcome

We’re glad you’re here and want to learn more about the Urban Model Builder!


## What is the Urban Model Builder?

The Urban Model Builder is a free, web-based tool for collaboratively creating, simulating, versioning, and sharing digital simulation models.  
It is built on the open-source [simulation library of the InsightMaker tool](https://github.com/scottfr/simulation) and is freely available on GitHub.  
With the Urban Model Builder, you can co-model System Dynamics and Agent-Based models in particular.  
The low-code interface lets you connect different building blocks on a graphical workspace to create simulation models. Based on your own parameter values or real datasets, simulation calculations are performed in real time.

### Key Features
- Open source (GPL-3.0 License)
- System Dynamics and agent-based modeling
- Integrated OGC API interface for connecting geospatial data
- Real-time collaborative modeling
- Model validation, simulation, and versioning
- Share, publish, and clone models


## Who are we?

The Urban Model Builder was developed as part of the “CUT – Connected Urban Twin” project at the City Science Lab of HafenCity University Hamburg for collaborative modeling.  
The project, in cooperation with the cities of Hamburg, Munich, and Leipzig, works on digital solutions for sustainable and inclusive urban development.  
Want to know more about the project? You can find more information [here](https://www.connectedurbantwins.de/).

If you have questions, feel free to contact us at **cut@hcu-hamburg.de**.


## Our vision

An integrated, resilient, and future-ready approach to urban development through the use of urban digital twins – a [modular system](https://www.connectedurbantwins.de/urbane-digitale-zwillinge/das-baukastensystem/) made up of urban data, algorithms, and applications.  
The Urban Model Builder is part of this digital toolbox, supporting transparent and co-creative modeling of complex systems and the testing of different future scenarios.  

So, what if you had a tool that made it easier to make informed, data-driven decisions? Give it a try!


## Create your first model

1. First, you can test the demo version, which gives you access to individual [building blocks](Primitives.md) to experiment with.
2. Convinced? Then create your own account – it’s as easy as signing up with your email address – and start modeling!
3. Interested in further developing the tool? Learn more about the Urban Model Builder’s architecture on [GitHub](https://github.com/citysciencelab/urban-model-builder).
