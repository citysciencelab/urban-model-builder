# Version Settings

Versioning is an important tool, especially when working with digital models over the long term or in a collaborative environment.  
It allows you to clearly document changes to a model, archive earlier states, and run experiments without losing the current version.

**Why is versioning important?**
- **Traceability:** Every change (e.g., new primitives, modified parameters, changes in flow structure) can be tracked later.

:::tip Version Index
Model version names are generated automatically and **cannot** be changed manually.

v0.0.1 : Initial model  
v0.0.2 : New draft  

v0.1.0 : Minor version  
v0.1.1 : New draft  

v1.0.0 : Major version  
v1.0.1 : New draft

- **Error correction:** If unintended errors occur, you can revert to an earlier version.

:::warning
You cannot delete individual drafts â€” only the entire model.
:::

- **Comparability:** Different model variants (scenarios) can be compared with each other.
- **Documentation:** For academic work or projects, versioning provides a transparent record of the modeling process.
- **Collaboration:** In team projects, different contributors can see who made which changes and when.

:::tip
If you want to use a published model as the basis for your own, either create a new draft (if you have permission) or clone it so you can edit it.
