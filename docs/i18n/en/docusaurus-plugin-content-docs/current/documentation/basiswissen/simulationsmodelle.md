# Simulation Models


## Welcome to the Simulation Models section!
In this section, you will find an overview of the different types of simulation models used in urban modeling. We will explore the fundamental concepts and methodologies that underpin these models, providing a solid foundation for understanding how urban processes can be simulated effectively.
## What are Simulation Models?
Simulation models are computational tools that replicate real-world processes to analyze and predict outcomes. They are essential for understanding complex urban systems, allowing researchers and planners to visualize scenarios, test hypotheses, and make informed
