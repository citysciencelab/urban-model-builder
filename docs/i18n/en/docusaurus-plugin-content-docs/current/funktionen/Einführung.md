# Introduction

## Describing Processes: Definitions, Equations, and Functions

A core element in building digital simulation models is the use of **mathematical functions**. These functions allow you to precisely define logical sequences, mathematical relationships, and dependencies between the individual system components.  

Functions can be embedded in Stocks, Flows, Variables, and other Primitives. They serve to **dynamically change states** or **trigger specific actions** within the model. Both simple mathematical operations and more complex expressions—following a simplified programming logic—can be used.  

By embedding functions directly into the modeling workflow, the Urban Model Builder offers an **intuitive and flexible way** to handle model logic.  

Since the Urban Model Builder is based on the open-source simulation library **simulation**, its functionality builds upon the foundation described in the library’s [documentation](https://insightmaker.com/help).
