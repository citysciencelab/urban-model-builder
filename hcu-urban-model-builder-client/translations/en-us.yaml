  feature1:
    title: Collaborate on "What If?" Scenarios with the Urban Model Builder
    description: Collaborate with others in real-time to build and simulate urban models - such as population models, transportation models, and land use models. Share your models with the community, clone the models of others, and create versions of your models.
  feature2:
    title: ABM, SD and more
    description: Create agent-based models (ABM), system dynamics models (SD), and other complex simulations - directly in your browser and without programming knowledge.
  feature3:
    title: (Realtime) Data from Urban Data Platforms
    description: Use real-time data from urban data platforms like the Urban Data Platform Hamburg to simulate your models. Connect to OGC APIs, query data, and visualize results. The Urban Model Builder already integrates the Urban Data Platform Hamburg to help you get started. Query data, visualize it, and use it in your models.

  comodeling: What is Co-Modeling?
  comodeling_description: Co-modeling is a collaborative process where multiple individuals or organizations work together to create and simulate models. This allows for the integration of different perspectives and expertise to develop a variety of models. The Urban Model Builder is a web-based tool for co-modeling and provides a user-friendly interface where users can collaboratively work on models. By integrating real-time data and enabling model sharing and cloning, easy collaboration with models is prioritized.
  oss: Open Source & Open Standards
  oss_description: The Urban Model Builder is an open-source project based on open standards. As a simulation engine, it relies on the JavaScript open-source library <a href="https://github.com/scottfr/simulation" target="_blank">simulation</a>, which originates from the <a href="https://insightmaker.com" target="_blank">Insight Maker</a> project. To integrate data directly from the Urban Data Platform Hamburg, it uses the open OGC API - Features interface. For sharing models with other applications, the Urban Model Builder implements the OGC API - Processes standard. As part of the <a href="https://connectedurbantwins.de" target="_blank">Connected Urban Twins</a> project, it was developed as Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) to create an open and accessible platform for modeling urban systems. Both the frontend and backend are licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.de.html" target="_blank">GPL-3.0 license</a>. This means that the source code is freely available and can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone.
