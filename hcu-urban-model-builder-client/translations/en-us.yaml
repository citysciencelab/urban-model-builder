  feature1:
    title: Collaborate on "What If?" Scenarios with the Urban Model Builder
    description: Collaborate with others in real-time to build and simulate urban models - such as population models, transportation models, and land use models. Share your models with the community, clone the models of others, and create versions of your models.
  feature2:
    title: ABM, SD and more
    description: Create agent-based models (ABM), system dynamics models (SD), and other complex simulations - directly in your browser and without programming knowledge.
  feature3:
    title: (Realtime) Data from Urban Data Platforms
    description: Use real-time data from urban data platforms like the Urban Data Platform Hamburg to simulate your models. Connect to OGC APIs, query data, and visualize results.
  video_not_supported: Your browser does not support the video tag.
  comodeling: What is Co-Modeling?
  comodeling_description: Co-modeling is a collaborative process where multiple individuals or organizations work together to create and simulate models. This allows for the integration of different perspectives and expertise to develop more realistic and comprehensive models. The Urban Model Builder promotes co-modeling by providing a user-friendly platform where users can collaboratively work on urban models. By integrating real-time data and enabling model sharing and cloning, collaboration is facilitated and the quality of models is improved.
